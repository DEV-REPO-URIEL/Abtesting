# Firebase Auth Development

This directory contains a set of samples and tests that integrate with
FirebaseAuth.

The Podfile specifies the dependencies and is used to construct an Xcode
workspace consisting of the samples, modifiable FirebaseAuth library, and its
dependencies.

## Usage

```
$ pod update
$ open Samples.xcworkspace
```
Then select a scheme and run.

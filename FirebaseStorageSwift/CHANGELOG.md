# Unreleased

# v0.1
- Initial public beta release. Extend the Storage Reference API with the Swift
  Result Enum type for all APIs that return an optional type and optional Error.
  To use, add `pod 'FirebaseStorageSwift'` to the Podfile and 
  `import FirebaseStorageSwift` to the source. Please provide feedback about
  these new APIs and suggestions about other potential Swift extensions to
  https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/issues.
